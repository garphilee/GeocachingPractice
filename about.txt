Goal: To scrape website, such as <https://manchesterorchestra.com/>, identify tour location stops (venues), upload to custom Google Maps

Step 1: Want to scrape music tour location data from site; (Maybe) Use 'requests' to save html file (or whatever it is)
	- though, some difficulty in scraping complete html data, for some reason (note: 05/10/22)

Step 2: Use RegEx to isolate location data

Step 3: Write location data to spreadsheet/csv - (used xlsxwriter for .xlsx file)
	- tried csv(csv): couldn't get to write to individual cells
	- tried xlwt(xls): couldn't create file
	- tried pyexcel_ods(ods): couldn't create file
	- xlsxwriter(xlsx): Worked!!

Step 4: Upload spreadsheet of location data to Google Maps to create custom map of tour venue locations
	- so far done manually, is there automatic way?
